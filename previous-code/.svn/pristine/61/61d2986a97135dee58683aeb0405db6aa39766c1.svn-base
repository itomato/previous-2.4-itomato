NOTE: This procedure is only valid when using SLiRP as network interface. If 
      using PCAP as network interface, you have to configure with the values 
      valid on your local network and instead of auto-configuration set most 
      values manually. If your router does not support the Routing Information 
      Protocol version 1 you have to statically configure the router address. If 
      using PCAP or if you do not intend to use Previous' internal NFS server 
      for filesharing or netbooting you may also choose your own hostname. 
      Please note that it has to consist of a maximum of eight lower case 
      letters.


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 1.0 and later:

1. On first boot you might be prompted to press 'c' or you might be dropped to 
   the single user mode console. If prompted to press 'c' just do so or if on 
   the single user mode console just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open Terminal (you find it in /NextApps directory) and use these commands to 
   copy the files that need to be modified to your home directory "/me":
      touch /me/resolv.conf
      cp /etc/hosts /me

3. Open "/me/resolv.conf" and add these two lines to the file:
      domain home
      nameserver 10.0.2.3

4. Open "/me/hosts" and append the following lines at the end of the file:
      10.0.2.15 previous
      10.0.2.254 nfs

5. Use these commands from the command line (Terminal) to copy and load the 
   edited files:
      su
      cp /me/resolv.conf /etc
      cp /me/hosts /etc

6. Open NetManager (you find it in /NextAdmin directory), go to "Local..." and 
   configure with these values:
   a  For "Network Type" select "NetInfo Network"
   b  For "Yellow Pages Domain Name" select "None"
   c  For "Hostname" select "Autoconfigure"
   d  For "Address" select "Autoconfigure"
   e  For "Router" select "Dynamic"
   f  For "Broadcast Address" select "Default"
   g  For "Netmask" select "Default"
   h  Hit "OK" and confirm all messages. It will reboot. Done.

NOTE: On NeXTstep 3.0 and later NetManager is called HostManager, "Network Type" 
      is called "NetInfo Binding" and "NetInfo Network" is called "Bind to 
      network NetInfo server".
      On NeXTstep 2.0 and later "Yellow Pages Domain Name" is called "NIS Domain 
      Name".


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 0.9:

1. Make sure Ethernet is disconnected before the first boot. During the boot 
   process you might be prompted to press 'c' or you might be dropped to the 
   single user mode console. If prompted to press 'c' just do so or if on the 
   single user mode console just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open Preferences (you find it in /NextApps directory) and go to the 
   "Password" preferences panel. Set a password for "me" (leave old password 
   field empty) and log out. You will then get the log in panel. Log in as super 
   user by entering "root" in the "name" field and leaving the password field 
   empty (press Enter twice).

3. Open NetManager (you find it in /NextDeveloper/Apps directory) and select 
   "Local Configuration...". Set "Network Type" to "Non-NeXT Network" and click 
   "Save". Confirm all messages until you are asked if you want to reboot. Skip 
   reboot.

4. Open Shell (you find it in /NextApps directory) to create, open and modify 
   some files as follows:
   a  Create and modify "/etc/resolv.conf" with these commands:
         touch /etc/resolv.conf
         open /etc/resolv.conf
      Append these two lines to the file
         domain home
         nameserver 10.0.2.3
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save.
   b  Modify "/etc/hostconfig" with these commands:
         open /etc/hostconfig
      Set the values as follows 
         HOSTNAME=-AUTOMATIC-
         INETADDR=-AUTOMATIC-
         ROUTER=-ROUTED-
         NETMASTER=-NO-
         YPDOMAIN=-NO-
         IPNETMASK=-AUTOMATIC-
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save. If a line does not 
      already exist, just create it.
   c  Modify "/etc/hosts" with these commands:
         open /etc/hosts
      Append these two lines to the file
         10.0.2.15 previous
         10.0.2.254 nfs
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save.

5. Open NetInfo (you find it in /NextDeveloper/Apps directory) and go to 
   "users" > "me". Double click the field right to "passwd" containing the 
   encrypted password and delete the contents of the field. Press OK and quit 
   NetInfo.

6. Connect Ethernet and from Shell reboot using this command:
      reboot
   Done.

NOTE: If you prefer to statically configure the router you have to modify the 
      file "/etc/rc" by replacing the term
         /usr/etc/route add default $ROUTER 0
      with the term
         /usr/etc/route add default $ROUTER 1


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 0.8:

1. Open the file "/etc/hosts" and append the following lines to the file:
      10.0.2.15 previous
      10.0.2.254 nfs

2. Open the file "/etc/resolv.conf" and append the following lines to the file:
      domain home
      nameserver 10.0.2.3

3. Open Shell (you find it in /bootdisk/NeXT/Apps directory) and use these 
   commands to write the hostname to the disk label and reboot:
      su
      disk -t XT-8760S-512 -H previous /dev/rsd0a
      touch /bootdisk/fastboot
      reboot

4. You can now do some basic networking like telnet to a specific IP address or 
   set up an NFS share. Note that resolving host names via DNS does not work.

NOTE: The /etc/rc.boot script configures the network with this command:
         ifconfig en0 10.0.2.15

      The router can be statically configured by modifying the /etc/rc.local 
      script. You need to replace the lines
         if [ -f /etc/routed ]; then
            /etc/routed &
            (echo -n ' routed') >/dev/console
         fi
      with the lines
         if [ -f /etc/route ]; then
            (/etc/route add default 10.0.2.2 1) >/dev/console
         fi


HOWTO: Reset network configuration:

1. If you have a system that does not seem to be configured properly and you 
   can't fix it by using the above instructions you can try resetting system 
   configurations. Note that all configurations including passwords will be
   reset.

2. Boot into ROM Monitor and use the following command to boot into single user
   mode (replace "bsd" with "bod" for Optical Disk):
      bsd -s

3. During the boot process you will be dropped to the single user mode console.
   Use this command to restore "/private/etc" and continue booting:
      (cd /usr/template/client/etc; tar cf - .)|(cd /private/etc; tar xpBf -)
      exit
