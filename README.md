# Tweaks
This is a modification to the Previous SDL GUI to change from an Atari font to a more appropriate font, Apple Monaco.

Instead of the 'X-ed out blob' icon Hatari uses to represent a directory, we have a simplistic 'folder' icon.

It's a more or less complete replacement of all the characters, but as an American, it's difficult for me to ID and test all the characters represented.

The GIMP was used to load and replace the character set. A patched up XCF file is included. It uses a 10x16 grid, and *should* still have the appropriate letter/line spacing to make replacement a type-and-go operation.

I wanted to use Ohlfs, but can't seem to get the font converted for use on the Mac. May still try ;)

## Workflow for the curious:

### Fonts and Icons:

- Import original Hatari bitmap into GIMP
- Apply grid over bitmap
- Monaco (without antialiasing) characters were used where possible (see folder icons for exception)

This is where I'm fuzzy, some 1.5Y later.. I either used GIMP's native C header export or a command pipeline. Time will tell.

### Colors

I have also changed the colors in the SDL GUI to closely reflect the default gray of interface elements as shown on a 24bit display (NeXT-native Gamma).
