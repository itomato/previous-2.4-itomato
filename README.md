#Previous DMG Build

This directory contains the bits and pieces needed to create a macOS DMG with [appdmg](https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg).

#Install appdmg

    npm install -g appdmg

#Generate DMG

Copy a new build of Previous.app from src/ to this directory. Edit the JSON if necessary, and run appdmg like:

    appdmg previous.appdmg.json ~/Previous.dmg ; open ~/Previous.dmg

#Contents

Previous.icns (I made this one to mimic the Peripherals boxes)

background.png (snazzy hidden folder background)

previous.appdmg.json (JSON package defs)

# Tweaks
This is a modification to the Previous SDL GUI to change from an Atari font to a more appropriate font, Apple Monaco.

Instead of the 'X-ed out blob' icon Hatari uses to represent a directory, we have a simplistic 'folder' icon.

It's a more or less complete replacement of all the characters, but as an American, it's difficult for me to ID and test all the characters represented.

![](monaco-sdl-gui.jpg)

The GIMP was used to load and replace the character set. A patched up XCF file is included. It uses a 10x16 grid, and *should* still have the appropriate letter/line spacing to make replacement a type-and-go operation.

I wanted to use Ohlfs, but can't seem to get the font converted for use on the Mac. May still try ;)

## Workflow for the curious:

### Fonts and Icons:

- Import original Hatari bitmap into GIMP
- Apply grid over bitmap
- Monaco (without antialiasing) characters were used where possible (see folder icons for exception)

This is where I'm fuzzy, some 1.5Y later.. I either used GIMP's native C header export or a command pipeline. Time will tell.

### Colors

I have also changed the colors in the SDL GUI to closely reflect the default gray of interface elements as shown on a 24bit display (NeXT-native Gamma).
